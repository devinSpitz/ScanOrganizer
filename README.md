# ScanOrganizer


Features:
=======
* Sort your scans into folders by SortTags
* Add Folders to the monitoring to automatically sort new scans in form of images or pdfs

Good to know:
=======
* Images are just internally converted to pdfs on a file per file base. Multiple images are not getting group into single files.

Tips:
=======
Use this software with naps2 to also group your scans into one file when needed.
